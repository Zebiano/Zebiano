<h3 align="center">Hey there! I'm Zeb.</h3>

<hr>

**Glad to have you on board!** Here's some info about me:

- 🔭 I'm currently updating the [AFK-daily script](https://github.com/zebscripts/AFK-Daily) for AFK Arena (mobile game) daily, as well as maintaining [Labeler](https://github.com/Zebiano/Labeler) and [Voyager](https://github.com/LabPath/Voyager) up to date and running.
- 🌱 I'm mainly a NodeJS back-end developer who loves creating APIs and anything that is related to JavaScript. I also like to automate any repetitive task in my life and have a special interest in AI.
- ⚙️ I mostly work with `.js`, `.sh` and `.md`.
- 💬 Contact me through [Discord](http://discordapp.com/users/241655863616471041) under `Zebiano#2989`! Ask me anything, I promise I'll always answer honestly.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm colorblind and I once had a viral 9GAG post.

Most of my GitHub repositories will probably be personal projects where I felt the need for something that didn't exist yet or that I couldn't find online, so I made it myself. Take a look around, I'm sure at least *one* repository will interest you!
